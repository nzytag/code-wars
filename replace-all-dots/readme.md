# code-wars

This repo was created to track all my Code Wars solutions throughout 301

Replace all dots was our first challenge for 301!
We were given a piece of code and we needed to find the bug in order to run correctly.
I did some reading and came across a new concept. Using the 'g' next to it meant it needs to keep searching and replacing instead of stopping at the first replaced dot.
